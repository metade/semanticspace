= semanticspace



== INSTALL

The following libraries are required to install the semanticspace gem:

* SVDLIBC - http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC/
* libsemanticspace - https://forge.ecs.soton.ac.uk/projects/semanticspace/

=== Installing SVDLIBC

Installing SVDLIBC can be a little tricky, as I find the Makefile tries to copy files to /.
I usually:
* download and uncompress the SVCDLIBC tarball from http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC/
* cd SVDLIBC
* make 
* sudo cp svdlib.h /usr/local/include/
* sudo cp libsvd.a /usr/local/lib/

=== Installing libsemanticspace

Download the latest release from:
https://forge.ecs.soton.ac.uk/projects/semanticspace/

It should be a matter of running:
* make
* sudo make install
